## Teamwork Experience
During this course's team project, I faced a significant challenge in managing a disruptive team member, often referred to as "a bad apple," which had the potential to undermine the entire team's performance. And in fact, it did. 

In this scenario, our professor advised us to address the issue promptly by making a collective decision to remove the disruptive individual from the team **as soon as any warning signs appeared** and report the matter to the professor for a timely resolution.

I noted this here so it can act as a reminder for myself and all of my next projects. ^^
