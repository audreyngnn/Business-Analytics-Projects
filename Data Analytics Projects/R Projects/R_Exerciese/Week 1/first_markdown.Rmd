## Header 1 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring webpages. 

Use an asterisk mark to provide emphasis, such as *italics* **bold** 

This is a list: (need a space for it to work)

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3

```
Use back ticks to create a block of code
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

With R Markdown, you can insert R code chucks including plots:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
