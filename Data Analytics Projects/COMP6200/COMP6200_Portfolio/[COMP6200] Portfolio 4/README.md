# Portfolio 4: Heart Failure Prediction Analytics (MQ) .☘︎ ݁˖

## Brief
In my last portfolio, I will work on a dataset regarding heart disease prediction (heart.csv). I aims to develop classification models using the dataset containing 11 predictive features. This is vital for identifying potential heart disease cases, especially among individuals with existing CVDs or high-risk factors like hypertension and diabetes, allowing for timely intervention.

--> **Analysis Summary**
1. The models demonstrated good overall performance in identifying both positive and negative cases, with high accuracy, precision, and recall values.
2. However, the presence of false negatives, particularly in the logistic regression model, is concerning, emphasizing the need to prioritize the reduction of these misclassifications.
3. The AUC-ROC score suggests that both models have good discriminative ability, enabling effective differentiation between patients with and without heart disease.

## Objectives ✧ ̟
1. Investigate the dataset
2. Clean and Transform the data (if necessary)
3. Examine feature correlations
4. Implement Logistic Regression Model
5. Apply KNN Model.
6. Optimize the hyper-parameter K in KNN.
