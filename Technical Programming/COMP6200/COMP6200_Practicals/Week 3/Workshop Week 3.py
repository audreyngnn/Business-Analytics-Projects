The goal of this week's workshop is to become familiar with the Pandas `DataFrame` data structure and begin looking at some simple data analysis and visualisation.   We'll look at two sample data sets and perform some analysis on them.

"""## Auto MPG Data

Our first exercise is with some data on cars from the US containing information about car size and power and fuel consumption (miles per gallon or mpg).   We'll use this to explore the Pandas `DataFrame` options for selecting and plotting data and for computing statistics over columns.

First we read the data using `pd.read_table` since the data ([auto-mpg.data](files/auto-mpg.data)) is in a
space separated tabular format (take a look at the raw data to see what this means).   I've added an
explicit list of column headings and some options to `read_table` to get the data in the right format.

"""Now that you have the data in a DataFrame, write code in cells below to do the following:

* show the size of the data - how many rows and columns are there?
* select just the `mpg` column, find the mean value of MPG for all cars
* select all rows where the value of cylinders is 6, how many are there?
* what is the mean MPG for 6 cylinder cars?
* create a scatter plot of `mpg` vs `weight`
* create a similar plot but just for the 8 cylinder cars

 [10 Minutes to Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) for some hints.

"""## Adult Data Analysis

Next we'll work with a dataset described in Chapter 3 of the text - the [Adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) dataset:

> "hosted on the UCI’s Machine Learning Repository.1 It contains approximately 32,000 observations concerning different financial parameters related to the US population: age, sex, marital (marital status of the individual), country, income (Boolean variable: whether the person makes more than $50,000 per annum), education (the highest level of education achieved by the individual), occupation, capital gain, etc.

The data is stored in a file 'files/adult.data' in this repository. It is in CSV format but the text uses a
different method to read it in to a dataframe - the reason is that it is a slightly non-standard format with spaces after the commas.  I've shown an alternate way to read the data below that uses read_csv with appropriate arguments to read the data.  This ensures that it doesn't try to read a header line (since there isn't one) and skips initial spaces in values.  We explicitly set the column names from a list of strings.
"""

column_names = ['age', 'type_employer', 'fnlwgt', 'education', 'education_num',
                'marital', 'occupation',' relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'capital_gain',
                'capital_loss', 'hr_per_week', 'country', 'income']

"""Follow the textbook examples to complete the tasks below.  Note that cutting and pasting from the text
is a bit problematic since they use special quote character in the code - if you try to copy-paste the code you'll get syntax errors. Instead, type out the commands, it might help you remember them better too.

The first task is to create separate dataframes for males and females, and for males and females earning over 50K (four dataframes in all).  When you have done this, **display the mean, median and standard deviation of age for each group** (Section 3.3.1).

One criticism I have of the code in the text is that they use very short variable names like df and ml2.  I've called the main dataframe `adult`; I suggest you use slightly longer varible names (`males`, `males_high`) to make your code easier to read - although avoid really long names (`males_with_high_income`) as they can make your code hard to read.

Work out ([from the pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)) how to add labels to the axes in your plot - the code in the chapter doesn't show this.

Compare your plot with the plot in the textbook.  Does it look the same? If it does, then you made the same error as they did. Compare the y-axis in Figures 3.1 and 3.2 (left) for Males; are there more males or females between ages 30 and 40?

"""The issue identified in the textbook was an inconsistency in bin sizes between the male and female dataframes. Specifically, the histogram for males had bins set to 20, while the histogram for females had bins set to 10. The provided fix has addressed this inconsistency.

## Outliers

The text book Section 3.3.3 talks about removing outliers from the data, discarding values that lie a long way from the median or mean value.   For this dataset, they talk about removing any rows where the income is >50K but the age is below 22 or above 72 - basically saying that these values are unlikely to be real.   This is a reasonable thing to do but the code they give for it is buggy.  

They show this formula:

```
df2 = df.drop(df.index[
                      (df.income == ’>50K\n’) &
                      (df[’age’] > df[’age’].median() + 35) & (df[’age’] > df[’age’].median() -15)
])
```

Note that they are dropping from the dataframe `df` any rows where the income is high AND the age is greater than 72 (median + 35) AND the age is greater than 22 (median - 15).   So effectively the last term will have no effect.  
What they really mean is (age > 72) OR (age < 22).  Here are some expressions that express these constraints. I've printed the length of the dataframe after using the boolean expression to select the rows:
"""

print( len( adult[(adult.income == '>50K')] ))
print( len( adult[(adult.age > 72)] ))
print( len( adult[(adult.age < 22)] ))
print( len( adult[(adult.income == '>50K')  & ((adult.age > 72) | (adult.age < 22))] ))

"""Based on these expressions, we can drop rows outside of the target range using the `drop` method as in the textbook.  Note the use of `adult.index`.  The argument to drop is a series giving the indexes of the rows we want to remove from the dataframe.   So we filter the index of the dataframe using the boolean expression to get this."""

# remove outliers - people with high income who are too old or too young
adult_clean = adult.drop( adult.index[(adult.income == '>50K') &
                                      ((adult['age'] > 72) |
                                       (adult['age'] < 22))]

"""Note that unlike in the textbook, the minimum age is now 22 (not 19).

Given this filtered dataset, repeat the analysis in the remainder of section 3.3.3 to **determine whether the difference between males and females is changed once outliers are removed**. To do this you will need to compute versions of the male and female high earners age series with and without outliers removed.  You can do this directly from the `adult` and `adult_clean` dataframes.

## Write your analysis here

**This week's final checkpoint is to complete this notebook and also writing your analysis. Writing a brief commentary regarding numbers and plots is very important to highlight what you can conclude from your data exploration.**

**If you need help in finishing this week's notebook, kindly take help from your tutor. Also, refer to Chapter 3 of your textbook**

**Auto MPG Data:** As MPG increases, weight decreases.


**Adult Data Analysis:**
1. The male samples are predominantly concentrated between the ages of 30 and 40 while the females are predominantly concentrated between the ages of 20 and 30.
2. The contrast in promoting men versus women fluctuates, reaching its minimum at the age of 30 and its maximum at the age of 50.
3. The Pearson’s median skewness coefficient (=9.772577960962279) indicates the dissimilarity in the shape of the distribution between male and female age distributions.

## Challenge

If you complete this work in plenty of time, explore the dataset a little more to
familiarise yourself with some other features of Pandas dataframes. Example questions might be:

- does education level have an effect on income? Use [groupby](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/groupby.html) to look at the different values of the education variable and the number
of records in each group.  Select one or two groups and compare the low and high income bands for these.
- The `education_num` column is (I think) a numerical measure of the level of education of the person - higher for a higher level of qualification.  Look at the difference in this variable for groups defined by the `marital` variable: are married people more or less highly educated than those who are single?
