# Portfolio 2: Analysis of an E-commerce Dataset (Part 2) .☘︎ ݁˖

## Brief
On the same dataset, the objective of the second analysis task is to develop linear regression models for forecasting users' ratings on items. This follows a typical Data Science procedure: data exploration, model construction, prediction generation, and result assessment.

--> **Analysis Summary**
1. Features with higher correlations typically yield better results. 
2. Increasing the volume of training data leads to improved outcomes.

## Objectives ✧ ̟
1. Import the Cleaned E-commerce Dataset and Explore the Dataset.
2. Divide Data into Training and Testing Sets (2 cases for training:test - 90:10 and 10:90)
3. Train 4 Linear Regression Models with Feature Selection based on their corellation
4. Assess the models' performance
5. Visualize, Compare, and Analyze the Results

## Technical Proficiency  ๋࣭⭑
* Training and Evaluation Linear Regression Models
